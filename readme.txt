By day, Angela Lin is a 3rd-year undergrad studying Computer Science at the
University of California, San Diego.

By day, she is still a 3rd-year undergrad studying Computer Science at the
University of California, San Diego, but much more sleep-deprived this time.

In 2009, in order to fulfill a high school elective requirement, Angela took
an Intro to Java Programming class with the expectation that it would be
incredibly boring. She was wrong. She enjoyed doing her homework so much that
it was more play than work, which helped her decide that she must have pursue
a career in the Computer Science field.

She chose to enroll in UC San Diego because it was in state, had a good
program, and was close to the San Diego Zoo, which houses the only pandas
in California. Pandas are her favorite animals.

When Angela is not writing code or watching panda videos, she likes to
play video games, try new restaurants, and listen to audiobooks.
